Are you tired of having shaky footage ruin your video? Or do you want to make some cinematic, professional-looking shots? Let’s make a cheap and easy-to-make camera slider to solve these problems. In this project, we are going to make a motorized camera slider using Arduino. The entire system is made using off-the-shelf parts such as stepper motors, motor drivers and Arduinos and it is designed to be very versatile.
